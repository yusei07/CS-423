1. 
a) Recursion terminates when the base case is met. On the other hand, iteration terminates when the condition in the loop fails.

b) One benefit that recursion offers is that in some cases it can reduce the time complexity
of an algorithm, by breaking a problem down into smaller sub-problems that can be solved independently.
However, recursion also comes with a trade off. Having repeated recursive calls can carry large amounts
of memory usage and processor time, also leading to stack overflow.

2.
a) A recursively defined function or object that calls itself in its definition.

b) trace

c) Stack plays an essential role to the execution of the power function, as it stores the state of each function call,
keeps track of the order in which calls are made, and executes the base case that'll stop the recursion.

d) pseudocode

e)
